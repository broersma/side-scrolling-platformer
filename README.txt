# Coding assignment: Gameplay programmer

### Initial plan
1. Create a basic platformer (2 hours)
1. Add some kind of cool mechanic (2 hours)
1. Tweaking the gamefeel and polishing (4 hours)

### Decisions made
- Having a plan: as the assignment focuses on gamefeel, it seemed like a good idea to reserve 50% of the time on doing polishing. The other hard requirement was creating a **2D side-scrolling platformer**. I figured I could get the bare basics down in about 2 hours. Which would hopefully leave me 2 hours to make it a little more than "just" the first 10 seconds of Mario (or: 1 enemy, 1 powerup, a few platforms). :crossed_fingers:
